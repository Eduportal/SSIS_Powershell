Powershell Scripts for use with SQL Server and SSIS

This is a collection of utility scripts that I have found useful for my work. I wanted to share these scripts,
in case other people also found them useful.

Please feel free to take whatever you like. Give me credit, dont give me credit. Either way, its up to you. Just don't blame 
me if something goes wrong, as they are not covered under any warranty and are provided "as-is".

If you want to contact me, please feel free to visit my blog www.barkingcat.com.au 
or send me an email at a.l.jackson85@gmail.com.

Thanks,

Aaron
